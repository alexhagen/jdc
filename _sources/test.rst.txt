Example
-------

Below is an example on how to use ``jdc``. First we have to import the
class:

.. code:: python

    import jdc.jdc as jdc

Then, we have to make a dummy class:

.. code:: python

    class func(object):
        def __init__(self, A):
            self.A = A
            
    one = func(1.0)
    two = func(2.0)

Then, we want to add afunction to that class:

.. code:: python

    %%add_to func
    def y(self, x):
        print self.A * x**2

And now we can access that function from any method of that class.

.. code:: python

    one.y(5.0)
    two.y(10.0)


.. parsed-literal::

    25.0
    200.0


If we want to add a function to only one object of that class, we can do
that, as well:

.. code:: python

    %%add_to two
    def z(self, x):
        print self.A * x**3

.. code:: python

    two.z(5.0)


.. parsed-literal::

    250.0


Note that the function added to a class object is only available to that
object, not all objects of that class:

.. code:: python

    try: 
        one.z(5.0)
    except AttributeError:
        print "See, it doesn't have it!"


.. parsed-literal::

    See, it doesn't have it!


And that's it.
